# GitHubProject-Lab10 - Lab Descriptions


# **Lab 8**

## *Apple Catching Game*

I made an apple catching game where apples spawn randomly at the top, and you have to catch them at the bottom in the basket. Getting **1 apple** gives you **1 point**, but missing an apple sets your points to **0**!



# **Lab 7**

## *Snowflake Generator*

I made a Snowflake Generator that spawns snowflakes at the top of the screen with random Shapes, Sizes, and Brightness, and had a slight wind effect!



# **Lab 6**

## *Auto-Pong*

I made a game of Automatic Pong with 2 paddles that take in the distance to the nearest ball and hit them back and forth. You can spawn more balls by CLICKING!
